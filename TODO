Things still to do:

1. community/ ZenPacks - there are a few stragglers here that need to be categorized.

2. In a "default" file alongside each version file, a HOMEPAGE="http://foo.bar.com" entry should
   be created. The concept of the "global" file is that it would contain default settings that
   apply to every version of a ZenPack.

3. The Microsoft ZenPacks probably need a bit of re-organization. I have them in sys-microsoft
   and app-microsoft.
